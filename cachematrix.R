## Write a short comment describing this function
#makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

#Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. 
#For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.
#For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() i
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}

## Write a short comment describing this function
#cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
#If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
         i <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(9)

  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(i)
  i
